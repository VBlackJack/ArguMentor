    Backup rules for Android Auto Backup.
    SECURITY: Exclude sensitive data from cloud backups.

    Note: In full-backup-content, you can only exclude from domains that are
    implicitly included. Since we only include sharedpref, excludes for other
    domains are not needed.

    <!-- Include only SharedPreferences (safe, non-sensitive settings) -->
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="." />

    <!--
        The following are NOT backed up by default when using <include>:
        - database: User content in Room database
        - cache: Temporary files
        - file: DataStore preferences (datastore/)

        No explicit <exclude> needed as they're not in any <include> path.
